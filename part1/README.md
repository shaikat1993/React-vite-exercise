# React Vite Exercise

This repository contains my initial exercise to learn React using Vite, inspired by the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1/introduction_to_react) course.

## Project Overview

This project is a foundational step in learning how to build modern web applications with React. By utilizing Vite, a build tool that offers a fast development environment and optimizes the build process, I aimed to create a seamless setup for React development.

## Objectives

1. **Learn React Basics**: Understand the fundamental concepts of React, including components, state, and props.
2. **Use Vite for Development**: Set up a development environment using Vite to leverage its fast build times and hot module replacement.
3. **Create a Simple React Application**: Implement a basic React application to solidify the concepts learned.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shaikat1993/React-vite-exercise.git
    cd React-vite-exercise
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project's structure:

```

├── public/
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   └── index.html
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── App.jsx
│   └── main.jsx
├── .gitignore
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── vite.config.js
└── yarn.lock
```

### Key Files and Directories

- **public/**: Contains the static files, including the main HTML file.
- **src/**: Contains the source code of the application.
  - **components/**: Contains React components.
  - **main.jsx**: The entry point for the React application.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies which files and directories to ignore in the repository.
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that includes the React application.
- **package.json**: Lists the project dependencies and scripts.
- **vite.config.js**: The configuration file for Vite.

## Learnings and Reflections

This exercise provided a hands-on introduction to React and Vite. By following the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1/introduction_to_react) course, I was able to understand the core concepts of React and how to set up a modern development environment with Vite. 

## Future Improvements

- **Expand the Application**: Add more features and components to make the application more complex.
- **Styling**: Implement CSS or a CSS-in-JS solution for better styling.
- **Testing**: Add unit tests and end-to-end tests to ensure the application is robust.
